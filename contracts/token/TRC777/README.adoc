= TRC 777
This set of interfaces and contracts are all related to the [TRC777 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777).

TIP: For an overview of TRC777 tokens and a walkthrough on how to create a token contract read our xref:ROOT:trc777.adoc[TRC777 guide].

The token behavior itself is implemented in the core contracts: {ITRC777}, {TRC777}.

Additionally there are interfaces used to develop contracts that react to token movements: {ITRC777Sender}, {ITRC777Recipient}.
